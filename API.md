## rpg.build_list_of_gratings(func_string, directory_path, options):

Builds a range of gratings varying over one property. One of the options supplied can be a list, and the function will iterate over that list building gratings matching each element of this list

* Parameters:
  * func_string (string) - String matching either "grating", "mask" or "gabor", to produce full screen gratings, gratings with a circular mask, or gabors, respectively  
  * directory_path (string) - An absolute or relative path to the directory where where the above files will be saved. Most likely, each set of gratings generated with this function will be saved in their own directory so can be displayed with the Screen.display_rand_grating_on_pulse()  
  * options: A dictionary containing options, see build_grating(), build_masked_grating() or build_gabor() for appropriate options, but note one of the options must be in the form of a list, e.g. `options["angle"] = [0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330]` will create the typical 12 orientation set of stimuli

* Returns:
  * None

Files will be saved with names matching the element of the list they are generated from. e.g. if generated with options["angle"] = [0 45 90], then there will be three files generated with names "0", "45" and "90" in the directory specificied in  directory path.  

## rpg.convert_raw(filename, new_filename, n_frames, width, height, refreshes_per_frame)

Converts a raw video/image file saves as uint8: RGBRGBRGB... starting in the top left pixel and proceeding rowwise, into a form readily displayed by RPG.

* Parameters
  * filename (string) - The exact path to the raw file, either as relative or absolute e.g. "~/videos/raw1.raw".
  * new_filename (string) - The exact path of the converted file to be produced e.g. "~/raws/raw_converted.raw".
  * n_frames (int) - The number of frames in the raw video/image. Do not use to shorten movies. Only limits how long the movie is played. Not how many frames are converted.
  * width (int) - The width of the original file in pixels. Cannot be used to resize images/movie
  * height (int) - The height of the original file in pixels. Cannot be used to resize image/movie
  * refreshes_per_frame (int) - The number of monitor refreshes to display each frame for. For a movie to display at 30 frames per second, on a 60 Hz monitor, this would be 2. On a 75 Hz monitor, 25 frames per second would be acheived by setting this to 3. If a still image is displayed, if you require it displayed for X seconds, and your monitor refresh rate is R Hz, then this value should be set to X * R.
  * colormode (int) - THe number of bits per pixel, 16 or 24. Defaults to 16.

* Returns:
  * None

# rpg.Screen(resolution, background)

A class encapsulating the raspberry pi's framebuffer, with methods to display animations gratings and solid shades to the screen.  
 
ONLY ONE INSTANCE OF THIS OBJECT SHOULD EXIST AT ANY ONE TIME. Otherwise both objects will be attempting to manipulate the memory assosiated with the linux framebuffer. If a resolution change is desired first clean up the old instance of this class with the close() method and then create the new instance, or del the first instance. The resolution of this screen object does NOT need to match the actual resolution of the physical display; the linux framebuffer device is automatically scaled up to fit the physical display. The resolution of this object MUST match the resolution of any  animation files ; if the resolution of the animation is smaller pixels will simply be misaligned, but if the animation is larger then attempting to play it will cause a  segmentation fault.

* Parameters:
  * resolution (int tuple) - Defaults to (1280,720). a tuple of the desired width of the display  resolution as (width, height).  
  * background (int) - Defaults to 127. value between 0 and 255 for the background. This is the shade that will display between animations and will NOT change the background color of any animation while it plays. 
  * colormode (int) - THe number of bits per pixel, 16 or 24. Defaults to 16.  

* Returns:
  * Screen object
  
## Methods
### load_grating(filename)

Load a grating file called filename into  memory. Once loaded in this way, display_grating() can be called to display the loaded file to the screen.

* Parameters:  
  * filename (string) - string containing the exact filename, either as an absolute  or relative, e.g. "~/gratings/grat1.dat" or "home/pi/grating/grat1.dat"

* Returns:
  * Grating object

### load_raw(filename)

Load a raw file into memory. Once loaded in this way, the returned  object can be displayed with display_raw()

* Parameters:  
  * filename: string containint the exact filename, either as an absolute or relative path, e.g. "~/raws/raw1.dat" or "home/pi/raws/raw1.dat"

* Returns:
  * Raw object
  
### display_grating(grating, trigger_pin):

Display the passed grating object (grating objects are loaded with the Screen.load_grating method) either as soon as possible or in response to a 3.3V trigger. Returns a namedtuple (from the collections module) with the fields mean_interframe, stddev_interframe and start_time; these refer  respectively to the average interframe time in microseconds, the standard deviation of the interframe time and grating began to play in Unix Time, respectively.

* Parameters:
  * grating (grating object) - a grating objected loaded with Screen.load_grating()
  * trigger_pin (int) - Deaults to 0. Set to 0 to display gratting as soon as possible or set to the GPIO pin (as defined by wiringPi) to wait for a trigger signal.  Trigger pin cannot be set to 1, as this is reserved for feedback. Note: digital signal is 3.3 volts max, not 5 volt TTL. 5 volt signals risk permanently damaging the raspberry pi.

* Returns:
  * Performance record as a named tuple with the fields fields mean_interframe, stddev_interframe and start_time.

 ### display_raw(raw, trigger_pin):
 
Displays the passed raw object (raw objects are loaded with the Screen.load_raw method) either as soon as possible, or in response to 3.3V trigger. Returns a namedtuple (from the collections module) with the fields mean_interframe, stddev_interframe and start_time; these refer  respectively to the average interframe time in microseconds, the standard deviation of the interframe time and grating began to play in Unix Time, respectively.

* Parameters:
  * raw (raw object) - a raw object loaded with Screen.load_raw()
  * trigger_pin (int) - Deaults to 0. Set to 0 to display raw as soon as possible or set to the GPIO pin (as defined by wiringPi) to wait for a trigger signal. Trigger pin cannot be set to 1, as this is reserved for feedback. Note: digital signal is 3.3 volts max, not 5 volt TTL. 5 volt signals risk permanently damaging the raspberry pi.

* Returns:
  * Performance record as named tuple with the fields fields mean_interframe, stddev_interframe and start_time.

Fill the screen with a solid color until something else is displayed to the screen. 

* Parameters:
  * color (int) - Value between 0 and 255.
  * blocking (bool) - Defaults to True. Decides whether the function is blocking until data is displayed for one frame. We can not think of any reason why you would want to set blocking to False, and the options is available for internal use.

Internal function for psudorandomizing gratings paths. If `algorithm` is set to "md5" file paths are hashed with MD5 to generate a string, which is then sorted to give order. This achieves a psuedo random order that is fixed across sessions. By calling with `algorithm` set to "shuffle", lists are randomized with `random.shuffle()` and hence are different on every call. 


* Parameters:
